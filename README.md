# Horiseon Code Refractor

I have been tasked with building a portfolio page, which I will use throughout my course and then continue to use afterwards to assist me with future employment. This portfolio will be the perfect way to showcase my ability in a fun and interactive way.  

To complete this I will be
*  Ensure my name, a photo, my work, and how to make contact are all clearly visible on my page.
* Ensure that navigation links are clear and working
* Ensure that my work section contains titled images of my applications with a link to the deployed application
* Ensure that the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
